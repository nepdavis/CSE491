# CSE491 - Special Topics in Computer Science: Bioinformatics

Course in bioinformatics and algorithms on strings taught by Professor Yanni Sun, spring 2018.

Homework implementations are below:

* HW01: Naive and Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithms for DNA protein string matching

* HW02: Suffix array pattern matching on DNA
* HW03: Burrows-Wheeler transform and FM index for DNA pattern matching
* HW04: Dynamic global alignment algorithm for DNA pattern matching modified to use linear memory (Needleman-Wunch and Hirschberg algorithms for alignment)
* HW05: Dynamic overlap alignment algorithm for DNA reads overlap

Project implementations are below:

* EM: Maximum-likelihood estimation, Bayes posterior classification, and Expectation-Maximization algorithm for two-state parameter estimation

* HMM: Two-state Hidden-Markov model with Viterbi decoding for classifying CpG islands in DNA sequences
